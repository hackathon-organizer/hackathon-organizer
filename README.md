# Hackathon Organizer Angular Frontend

The Hackathon Organizer is a great choice when you and your organization face the challenge of organizing a hackathon. This solution contains everything you need to easily prepare and hold the entire event. It provides a step-by-step process for creating a hackathon, allowing you to customize information about your company, set the event description, and upload a logo. Users with ideas for awesome projects can create a team by providing necessary information that can attract other members. Alternatively, if a participant is looking for a challenge, he can simply update his profile by choosing from many skill tags that will be used to find a corresponding team that matches his skill set. Users also have access to an interactive schedule where selected mentors can create meetings with participating teams. There is a real-time notification system and an extensive chat system that supports audio/video and screen sharing to enhance team collaboration on projects that can change the world.
